# Diabetes Prediction Model

This project focuses on building a logistic regression model to classify whether an individual has diabetes or not. Logistic regression provides valuable insights for early detection and risk assessment, enabling healthcare professionals to make informed decisions and provide appropriate interventions. This project aims to leverage the power of machine learning to improve diabetes diagnosis and promote proactive healthcare management.


## Dataset
The dataset used for this project, along with its detailed description, can be found on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset?datasetId=3102947.
## Method
1.   Logistic Regression Model: The scikit-learn library was utilized to build a logistic regression model for diabetes classification.

2.  Categorical Variable Conversion: Preprocessing steps were applied to convert categorical variables into numeric representations. This conversion enables the learning algorithm to effectively understand the data.

3. Scaling of Data: The training and test data were scaled using the standard scaler. Scaling helps normalize the features and enhances the performance of the model.
